const aboutMePara = `Hi there, I am Ishaan. A young passionate software engineer who loves to build web 
applications. When I completed my high school, even the name of computer science terrified me. This is what 
happens when you don't have complete knowledge of the subject. However, with limitless learning and 
experience, today I am doing Masters in Computer Science. After completing my undergrad I started working
as a Database developer using SQL and PL/SQL. But due to my insatiable hunger of learning I started studying 
about frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. With time I started working as a software 
engineer handling frontend part of the applications and I have accumulated more than 3 years of industrial experience.
Today Javascript is my favourite programming language along with React. Apart from my work I also do freelance
development which helps me in growing my skills and increase my learning. `;
